# Magic 8-Ball
This program uses Assembly language to implement a Magic 8-Ball that takes an input and outputs a phrase that is randomly picked

For Windows:
This was made on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio, so I found it best to run it from there.

For Linux:
- Type in "g++ -o <i>outputfilename</i> <i>inputfilename.cpp</i>" to compile
- Type in "./<i>outputfilename</i>" to run
